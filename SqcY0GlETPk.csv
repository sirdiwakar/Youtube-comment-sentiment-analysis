@MindCode86,"Good tutorial, fast, precise and good information density."
@el-3omda476,is this outdated or something cause i dont have tsx extension on my files it's js and the folder structure is different ??
@rafalp6584,Do someone know what vsc theme Josh uses?
@agony4181,"Im used Enum for state...

export enum ButtonState {

@brandongaynier6818,Went to the website and purchased the course... hands down the best money I've ever spent.
@user-pz1ys8jj4m,"Why do you zoom in to the code so much? I want to be able to see more code than a few truncated lines. 

Also seeing a warning on ""onClick={handleClick}"":


Type '(event: MouseEvent) => void' is not assignable to type 'MouseEventHandler<HTMLLIElement>'.
  Types of parameters 'event' and 'event' are incompatible.

Solution: ""onClick={() => handleClick}"""
@Kariim_Atef,good luck
@Kariim_Atef,you're the best
@Kariim_Atef,thanks so much
@vipulsahu3992,🖤
@ilwozzone,"31:55 

The fix is to specify ""className""

<li className=""list-group-item"">{item}</li>"
@MehrabEvanC94,The best thing I like from his contents that he provides a great overview review with the simplest explanation in 1-2 hours duration which is very easy to grab the basics which is the most required objectives for a software engineer to go for agile approach.
@user-xy8su2iw5y,Short-time video uploaded then please
@rydinorwin,"Not great with terminal, I got to 8:26, code . did not work, Mosh says if that does not work simply drag and drop that folder into VS Code,, helps to do this would be appreciated! Many thanks! Yeah, so far I can't get the server in Vite going!?"
@user-yi6cf9qt6z,The video is great but there's like sooo many ads!!!!
@TKollaKid,"This course was incomplete. I purchased the React course bundle a few months ago and went through both courses. Doesn't provide enough depth and breadth. Missed a lot of important concepts. What I particularly found disappointing was that authentication was not covered. Instead, at the end of the last course, he says buy my Next course to learn authentication. I don't want to buy and take another course to learn Next. I want to learn React. I found that dishonest. I also don''t like how much refactoring he does. It makes for messy notes and difficult to follow. Do it correctly in the first place. I've literally purchased over 10 courses from Mosh over the past couple of years and most are great. But this one fell short. It felt rushed. I ended up taking the React course by Maximilian Schwarzmüller on Udemy. It is significantly better. I have a university degree in computer science with 7 years of experience."

@nacholiron,"The ""passing children"" section didn't work at all. The Alert worked while passing the literal, but the changes to pass it as Props, didn't work. I tripled checked, and my alert gets the blue component but the text remains undefined when consoled. From that point on, nothing else worked as expected despite having the exact same code."
@steveelliott8852,Hi Guys is this course good for a beginner I'm good at html & css I'm OK at javascript still learning people keep on telling me to learn react thanks Steve
@meditationmusic9488,This course is a game like for me. Enjoyed 1000%
@kingshanaman,"How did you get your terminal looking like that, with colours and git branch names?"
@nacholiron,what icon set you use in vs code?
@budsodalsky,"""beautiful"""
@trackstar127,"At the 1:00:38 mark the shortcut you have for Alerts is not working for me. I followed your steps at least 10 times now and keep running into the same issues. The rafce is working to generate the code but when I go back to App.tsx, the syntax involving <Alert /> isn't being recognzed. 

Alert.tsx is also automatically removing the () that should come after return statement."
@megamasha,"Anyone else just get stuck at adding the List Group? Everything's fine at 23:19, but then after following all the instructions (and double- and tripple-checking my changes), the page is blank at 24:38. If I include a ListGroup component in the page, the page is blank. If I remove it and just put a simple tag lilke h1, it still displays fine."
@Hari983,Amazing tutorial. Great flow and easy to understand while still being well-detailed.

@MichaeljMr,"Thank you Mosh, took me a couple days to complete this first video, I watched it over the weekend without coding along and rewatched it over the past 2 days to try the button and alert solution myself (failed miserably :p)... it's just a case of trying to remember the syntax and how to build components consitently. I just bought your react 18 for beginners for 17 eu which is a fair price for 8 hours of content. Might consider subscribing for a couple months after I complete this first one - will see how it goes! Looking to finally switch careers and become a software developer - hope this will be the boost in knowledge I need to launch my new carreer! Cheers and best of luck!"
@huhtis6087,"Hey Mosh and thank you for great tutorial. In this tutorial I also learned how to create connect on VS Code to my Ubuntu-server and create these application to there. But I have a question. in Button component, why my bootstrap is not working. My code is identical to your code, but still button is basic Black and white button. className (property) says ""undefined"" but other classNames has been worked well."

I hope I can build a new project without Vite,  just with ReactJS and Typescript. My official Launch was 1st Jan 2024. But now it is not possible anymore. Other than that everything in this tutorial was good.  I think I will just put the UI alone and setup my Website. for now. Will have to do the painfull process of either working with vanilla ReactJS or anything else out there to fix this issue. Hopefully I won't have to rework my AI Webservice integration.s"

@PongGod,"Kudos for putting together such an excellent tutorial. This is one of the extremely rare instances where I went through an entire programming tutorial and everything actually worked! So many times I run into problems where things aren't working on my end the way they do in the tutorial, which forces me to spend a bunch of time trying to figure out what went wrong, mounting frustration, and ultimately just giving up.

I would like to ask you a probably silly question.
What if we first have a ""Main Menu"" at the center of the screen ?
Say something like:

and by clicking ""Games"" we select the Games app (or better the Games section)
by clicking Music we go to the Music one and so on ?
Could it be done with React or Angular is better ?

@VTski3r,Has anyone else experienced the hmr update not automatically working?  To view changes to the webpage I need to open up a separate live server which forces an hmr update in the terminal.

@fido9745,"I was confused about using a <Fragment> instead of a <div>, but I looked it up on google and found In React, ` ""Fragment"" and ""Div"" are used interchangeably. The main difference between the two is that ""Fragment"" clears out all extra divs from a DOM tree while ""Div"" adds a div to the DOM tree. With React Fragments, we can create code that is cleaner and easier to read. `"

@VapidVulpes,"this is the exact tutorial i need, but my thumbs up is even more for that subtle youtube thumbs up button highlight when you mention the icon in the tutorial. Classy!"
@losmilosmi1917,Thanx for this nice tutorial! BTW how come your comments are grey?
@HaifengZhu-pn3uq,"my favorite tutor, I like your explanation"
@ichig085,I'm a complete beginner with a pretty basic understanding of JS. I'm gonna do the course and see how it is.
@joeking5211,"Thks for your superb tutorial. I understood that React is one of the languages of the moment and have never seen any coding in it before hence chose this vid. I would just like to say I have programmed in C since the late '70's and there were people the world over at the time knocking it for being complex and confusing. Well, I;d just like to say here we are nearly 50 years on and I'm looking at a pile of bastardised HTML junk thrown together in almost unreadable and convoluted form, what total and utter morons ever sat down and conceived this absolute shite, more of a question what meds were they on. What an absolute abortion of language for 2023. Could they have made this any more of a complete mess if they actually tried, I feel not,  And think about how C was knocked for this way back then,  Who the hell comes up with these ideas and syntax, in the first 30mins of the tutorial I can't come up with anything that could be added to make it more obfuscated, so they really have done an excellent job in that department.
Your superb vid has made me aware of what React is ( or perhaps more is not ) and I am gobsmacked which is why I had to throw my bit in here, Who in their right mind would ever go anywhere near this junk when there are so many alternatives out there these day, I feel a quick vid on that would be very interesting as this is for sure strictly for the masochists to ever think about bothering with, and Why would you ???????????.
Thks again and 10/10 on your part but -10/10 for the state of React, have given Thumbs up for the vid, you certainly deserve it having to deal with it so deeply. Kind Rgds. Truly Stunned."
@astraea926,"“Learn react in one hour” doesn’t even explain the basic function syntax, he just outright uses it without explaining lmfao."
@hemantkumardas3333,Thanks sir...
@kris_gpt,"In 34:25 you say there is duplication in code and you will show a different way to achieve the same result. But the result is actually completely different. When you used if statement, you displayed either of two outcomes. After making condition in your ""simpler"" way you display both ! It is not visible as you used empty array, just use your list of cities and make some other condition :/"
@TheCalmer,"A1 1:20:03, I have a question.  When you had the Props property earlier and you said name: string, in the App.tsx file you said name=""me"" to pass the property to the component, but when you have children: string, how come you don't write something like children=""...""??"
@HrissW,Has anyone bought his react course or no? is it valid?
@DashingChannel,4:33 Just look at like buttons if your watching on your laptop. Something amazing will happen
@potatas_,one of the best channel
@TheCalmer,how do you get the import statement added automatically?  When I type useS there is no autocomplete and even when I type useState the import statement doesn't get added automatically.
@GambaBebum,"Tip, don't use react."
@qiupprogramme4484,Thank you for the video. Where can I find the 2nd part ?
@personnumber42,"Great tutorial! Extremely helpful. 

One question - how do you get the react hooks to auto-complete and auto-import? Didn't see that covered. Not sure if it is a different plugin or setting for Sublime Text (editor I'm using), but it seems packages are generally the same. Google isn't helping very much!"

@infomattersmost,"Brian need some help in understanding.  I created a website on for example a Wix type platform.  I was trying to implement a paypal subscription setup for payment, and it was not working.  So I hired someone, and they said it was impossible for the paypal subscription to be done because the Wix type platform was limited and Wix only lets users needs go but so far.  The guy i hired recommended he build me a React website and that he would deploy the React website on AWS.   Here is the problem, everytime I need something done to the website I have to contact him.  And obviously that will cost money for every little thing.  I told him its not right that i don't have complete access to the website that i paid him for.  He said he would create me a admin login so that i can do things like add products, edit text, add pictures.   I told him that works but to setup the admin that I would have full access to the code.  He said that is not possible.  Is he lying?  I mean how can I own my own website but not have access to the full code.  What happens if this guy gets hit by a car and dies, what then?  How will I be able to get full access to my website?  How about if I wanted to hire someone to add a Carousel Slideshow, and the person I hired needed access to the code, If i don't have access to the code, how can the person I hired have access?   I feel like i have no control over my website, and if i ever had a serious problem with this guy he could easily remove the website from the web and screw me over. I am sure as you are reading you already have an idea of whats going on and what I need to say to this guy.   Help please,"

@miladesmailpour192,"great quality content, but as soon you subscribe to their website they keep charging you even after unsubscribing. they don't let you delete your credit info and respond the way it is our fault, like we can do anything about the autorenewal, not fix their website issue which is not secure and reliable to add credit info."

@yacahumax1431,you give the impression that react HAVE to be used with node. but that is not the case.

@namaefumei,Bootstrap? Lol you gotta be kidding me.
@xternalmega,15:00 that part doesn't show up for me. I would have to rerun the npm run dev command in order for the site to show changes.
@Kidrock87,"Thank you for the tutorial! I have a question, or rather, observation. At 55:02, basically the section of ""Passing Functions Via Props"" while understanding that we can pass functions through props is important. The example's result of logging the item's name into the console could be solved easily with adding 1 line after setSelectedIndex(index); that is: console.log(item); which essentially does the exact same thing :DD

Definitely not me trying to devalue your tutorial video, rather, I'm quite happy that I noticed I could do a little something with how little I know of React thus far.

Thanks for the video again!"
@chetankulthe7878,"nice explanation, very useful for beginner like m"
@mindgauge5727,44:00 You used const handleClick = (event: MouseEvent) => console.log(event); in map so each time its value will be changed. But as far as I know constants don't allow to change its values. Please guide me what's going on here.
@SachinKumar91,Thank you for this tutorial Mosh. Appreciate your time and efforts for making such content.

  Its type '() => void' is not a valid JSX element type.
    Type '() => void' is not assignable to type '(props: any, deprecatedLegacyContext?: any) => ReactNode'.

@hadimomin4150,"you said we will be building that gaming project together in this course but you did not show a single thing about that in the whole video, do we have to purchase your react course for the project?"
@Iyht,"I been programming for 20 years now and it always amazed me how overcomplicated and redundant web dev is, you literally had to use 3 libraries (vite,react,bootstrap),  4 useful files and like 10 other useless files, 4 functions, and like 4 objects so that you can create 2 files(HTML and JS) that are going to actually do the work and create one simple close button. I just think is silly to have to use a compiler for typescript the whole purpose of interpreted languages like python and javascript is to not have to use a compiler...and if people really want type safety, why not use a faster and more formal language like C# or Java that were already design for that or just learn to program correctly. The idea that react applications help on debugging is clearly false by just looking at the complexity of the code and the special syntax. The only advantage that I see for things like typescript is intellisense, but I think there is easier ways of solving that problem. At this point its probably better to just use C++ 🤣"

@szablitho3439,"Hello watchers and Mr. Mosh. Is explanation in video of libraries and frameworks accurate? Well, i used to double check info on internet within different sources and i read that for example form validation can be done with React alone using for example if else statements.
Also if framework like Vue.js is a set of tools, i understood it has built in libraries for specific needs. However google told me you can add other libraries on it too.
How is it actually?"

@graniteprogrammingtutorials,"The biggest problem with this video is that it gets confusing and as a viewer I lose focus with the extra bootstrap, typescript and vite information instead of focusing just on REACT. I understand that these technologies are used in addition to REACT but for a complete newbie to REACT I find it hard to realize what is REACT code and what isn't. That being said I give this video an A+ for its content and delivery. Keep making great informational tutorials like this I love them!"

@blaineruffing4396,So im having an issue with the first real problem you went over and App is declared but it's value is never read. ts(6133)
@sadmanh0,"I don't understand something, in the Managing State section, you said that React is not aware of the selectedIndex variable and it's local to the function. So presumably this is because the var was declared outside the HTML snippet in the function return. In that case, how does React know about the setSelectedIndex function? I'm guessing it has something to do with the useState function? So whatever variable is in the second part of the useState array acts as the hook function? What happens if I put more than 2 things in that array?"

That ""scripts"" section in the package.json file are:
⚙ dev: This script runs the Vite development server. This server will watch your files for changes and automatically rebuild your project when you make changes.
⚙ build: This script builds your project for production. This means that it will minify your code and remove any unnecessary code.
⚙ lint: This script runs the ESLint linter on your project. ESLint is a tool that helps you to find and fix errors in your JavaScript code.
⚙ preview: This script runs the Vite development server in preview mode. This mode allows you to preview your project in a browser without having to build it first.

Hope it helps."

@rabbitlover7656,"Hello, honestly I have a question that drove me crazy, that there are many people who said that the C language does not contain object-oriented programming, and in fact according to the English books it says that the C language contains object-oriented programming, and many people hate the C language and resort to the C Plus Plus language because they claim that  The C language does not contain object-oriented programming, and this concept is very, very, very wrong according to the proven scientific books of the C languages. Unfortunately, many people criticize the C language because they claim that it is devoid of object-oriented programming. The problem is that those who claim that are experts and university professors.

@ast1897,"Good tutorial, but there are a couple of things that could be improved. He runs through the stuff really fast and constantly erases what was just coded. If I am new to react, I'd like to have an example of everything I'm practicing rather than wiping everything clean after each session. If he is going fast to keep the video short, that's fine, but what's with the music slides after each segment? Overall, it feels a bit like an infomercial and that's a turn off when considering the purchase of a full lesson plan."

The error ""Missing script: ""start"" appears. I tried adding a start script to the package.json files but it still would not run, it came up with the error ""module not found"" and I believe that this is due to the fact that I did not put the correct value in for the start script but I do not know what value to input, any advice would be greatly appreciated."

@johngoutung1229,"I did struggle to learn React. A lot of wasted time.
The problem? I did not know the basics of Javascript in first place. You need to walk before you can run.
So I took a few very basic books (books, not complex tutorials!) and learned the fundamentals.
After I learned the basics of Javascript, learning React became much easier.
Edit: For those asking about the books, for the very basics I learned with ""Javascript In Less than 50 Pages"". 
And to develop my knowledge I learned with ""Head First Javacript Programming""."

The tutorial is great but it's not ""React for Beginners""... it's ""A detailed tutorial on React with Typescript using Vite"" which is a lot different. 
That's fine too but you've gotta educate the beginners on what the hell these things are and why we're using them..

@waveless7323,BRO AWESOME COURSE. I purchased the part 1 course and I have already finished it and now I am confident in coding websites. I am eagerly waiting for the part 2 course. I am also asking a request to make an updated React Native course with expo and routing and a full mobile application tutorial with firebase as backend. Keep up the hard work!! 👍

My bookmark: 41:17"
@Liubov_110,"Mosh, Thank you so much for this excellent tutorial. 

As a Python Web developer on a studying stage sometimes I see mentions of React in job openings for fullstack development. Now it will no longer scare me, as it is with html/css/bootstrap collection.

By the way, I guess Django Template Language took {{ double curly braces }} only because {single ones} were reserved by JavaScript"
@samer9277,"I did everything you did upto 26:12, exactly the same and it didnt work. my page just dispalys list group 2 words in text and not in line breaking groups. this is really hard."
@thespiritualjourney369,if u r teaching react then y r u using typescript?. just simply use js instead.
@TheGaneshshow,Thanks a lot Mosh:))
@Harunaka10,"It's frustrating to follow this as a code along instead of in a lecture set up, because you give 0 time between saying what you're putting in and cutting away to move on to the next thing. I've had to pause like 8 times and go back because I'm trying to follow along and you've blown on to the next thing before I've started typing... at .75 speed."
@darma5637,"thanks, mosh i learn a lot from this one video.. from learn useState hooks, than how to handling props, and more, more."
@IsxaaqAcademy,Great tutorial
@marcw6875,"I bought the full course a couple weeks back because I saw it was on sale.  I've been enjoying it.  Prior to this my only comparable experience was making a web app for a class that used just vanilla versions of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP.  I'm liking how react comes together so far and have already been thinking I should try re-creating my class project using react.

I don't know if Mosh reads these comments very often, but if he does, I have just one critique for his classes.  I wish he would wait for at least a count of two after he types some long line of code before hitting tab, switching over to another file, etc.  Especially after he has typed something that he knows his students will be trying to type as well.  There have been so many times where I've been trying to wait until he types the full line before pausing, but then I miss it because he immediately moves somewhere else.  lol.  It's a minor nitpick, but I thought I would mention it.  Otherwise, I've liked how the course is set up and I'm looking forward to putting together the bigger project in the last section.  :)"

@StandaBlabol,"Thanks for very helpful tutorial!
It is nice to see that using function + TS approach - React just changed from ""bloody horrible"" to ""just hideous"", compared with Vue3.x script-setup + TS .
React is still pain but much better than previous class JSX version."

@rustyandduke282,"Hi Mosh, Loved the explanation. I'm new to React and all this. I believe we need to turn off the 'format on save' feature during the Alert component example, as I could see autoformat changed the code as well brackets were removed from the return statement on saving. Took a minute to figure it out what was wrong when my Alert box was not appearing even after adding correct bootstrap classes. But my main question is is there a way out , can we work with on it without disabling the 'format on save'  ??  🤔 TIA"
@tommasotranchese150,"this is  probably one of the best tutorials so far, I just wished you went a little slower sometimes cause I had to stop and catch up with the code, but overall I understood like everything, so it worked! thank you  <3"
@AfroditiK54,"I'm sure that you are very talented in what you do but oooohhhh this was very difficult to follow as a beginner. 
The problem is : you  first explained what we *shouldn't* do (like ""oh for this  you could type this code and bla bla"") and then what we *should* actually do (""but instead of doing what I said previously, do this!"") which was very confusing. I was banging my head throughout this video because I constantly had to delete the code I wrote in order to change it with a ""shorter"" or more advanced code. If you are making a beginngers video, first explain the very basics, even if they are  not the most convinient, and then move on to shortcuts etc."
@chasing.those.vistas4185,"Mosh, unfortunately, as soon as I started following the tutorial, I ran into an error when I ran the ""npm install"" after cd into react-app folder,

npm ERR!   dev vite@""^4.2.0"" from the root project""

I had started it a few days prior and everything was working fine - I got to around 50m, the start of the Props chapter. As soon as I loaded up my laptop this morning and tried looking at the list, nothing shows up, only this error in the console.

Any ideas? I tried it in a different browser and still got the same response."
@JasperZeroes,"You're a great tutor, Mosh."
@PlentyOfPooches,"BEWARE - Mosh is a scam - I bought his Mastering React course. The course told me to download a specific version of Node JS and React which is no longer supported. I therefore could not follow his videos at all. I sent a support note asking him to either update the course so that the technology is not out of date or refund my money. He didn't even have the decency to even respond to my request. Basically, he stole almost $200 of my money. I instead enrolled in a similar course on Udemy which was up-to-date and a great course. After this experience, I read a bunch of other reviews of this course and they all said the same thing. Please do not waste your money on any of Mosh's courses."

@ethanlal4517,"Mosh, plz do me a favour. I simply love Svelte and think its the best but sadly it isn't very popular and doesn't have a large community. As a result, people and companies can't use it in their projects as much as they want to. I might be asking too much but I would really appreciate it if you could create a free Svelte course on youtube because I believe it will really raise Svelte's popularity and give it the attention it deserves. Love ur vids, keep the good work on."
